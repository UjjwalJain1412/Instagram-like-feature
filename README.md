# Instagram-Like Pop-Up Feature

## Overview
This repository contains a frontend implementation of an Instagram-like pop-up feature for posts. The pop-up displays a larger view of the post with additional details, similar to how Instagram allows users to click on a post to view it in more detail without leaving the main feed.


## Customization
- **Styling**: Modify the CSS to match your website's design.
- **Post Data**: Update the HTML and JavaScript to dynamically load post data as per your requirements.
